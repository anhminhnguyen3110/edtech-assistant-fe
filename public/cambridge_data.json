        "context": "How can I start preparing learners for a Cambridge English Qualification?   by   Cambridge English ,  13/09/2021     Cambridge English Qualifications , Schools , Teaching      Are you thinking of preparing learners for a Cambridge English Qualification for the first time?  Our qualifications help students improve their English language skills step-by-step and keep them motivated throughout their learning journey.  This guide will show you how to assess your students level, provide some tips for teaching mixed ability classes, and share some extra resources to help you get started with exam preparation.  What are Cambridge English Qualifications?  Cambridge English Qualifications help millions of people learn English and prove their skills to the world.  Each exam focuses on a level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) . This helps identify your learners abilities on a six-point scale, so they can improve their speaking, writing, listening and reading skills step-by-step.  As your students develop these skills, they build confidence, and learn to communicate in a variety of real-life situations.  Which is the right level for my students?  If you never used Cambridge English Qualifications before, you might not be sure which is the right level for your learners. Follow these three simple steps to help guide you:  Step 1:  Look at the coursebooks you using in class. Are they aligned to the CEFR? If they are, this will give you a good indication of the appropriate level.  Otherwise, take a look at the way your learners have been grouped together. Do you know if they are beginners (CEFR levels Pre A1 or A1), elementary (A2), lower intermediate (B1), upper intermediate (B2), advanced (C1) or proficient (C2)?  Step 2:  Check out one of our sample tests at each level  which one closest reflects the ability of your learners? Why not try a full test with your students? Alternatively, take a few sections from the exam and try them out in class.",

Don forget that they probably won reach the target level at the start of the course. However, there is plenty of time for them to develop their English skills.  How can I prepare my students for a Cambridge English Qualification?  Once you chosen the best Cambridge English Qualification for your students, the next step is to make sure they are fully prepared.  Do I need to change how I teach?  There is no need to completely change your teaching plan for the academic year. Instead, you can supplement your teaching with test material and free resources we provide to help prepare for the exams. Use exam-style questions, monitor progress with practice tests, and make your learners aware of exam timing.  Do I have to change my coursebook to prepare learners for the exam?  You don need to change your coursebook, or the way you teach. However, it is a good idea to look at the teaching handbook for your chosen exam.  These include the language specifications for the exam, and information on what is tested for each of the four skills.  Nevertheless, if you do decide to change your coursebook, we offer a wide range of official preparation materials .  What other exam preparation materials are available?  There are lots of fantastic resources on our website to help fill in any gaps in your teaching materials.

        "context": "What the best way to learn receptive skills?   by   Miranda Hamilton ,  26/07/2021     Teaching , Cambridge English Qualifications , Schools      Insights into listening  We often think of speaking and writing as the most challenging of the four language skills but what about the receptive skills? With reading, learners have time to think, but listening in another language presents a very different set of challenges for the learner. How often have we heard learners complain  too fast, teacher! So how can you help?  Cambridge English has created a set of five Teacher Guides to developing listening skills for A2 Key for Schools , B1 Preliminary for Schools , B2 First for Schools , C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency .  These guides are designed to help teachers understand the subskills of listening, with activities, tips and strategies to help you develop your learners listening skills as they prepare for their exams.  Here are just a few of the ideas from the guides for you to try with your learners. They will work at all levels.  Activity  How many words?  This micro listening is a great activity to try towards the end of your listening lesson, when learners have already heard the recording, so they know the speakers voices and the topic.   Select a short phrase, of around 10 words, from the listening you have just completed. Set up the audio so you are ready to press   Tell the learners to listen and count the number of words they hear. You will need to play the audio several times. Pairs discuss. Take a range of answers from the class, but don tell them the answer just yet.  Write the phrase on the board and count the number of words with the class. Who was the closest?  Now ask them to listen and read the phrase at the same time. This time they have to decide which words they hear most clearly, in other words, you want them to notice the stressed words. Ask why they think they heard these words most clearly. Explain that stressed words carry the key information.",

Explain that stressed words carry the key information.   This micro listening activity helps raise learners awareness of sounds, helping them notice the stressed words and preparing them to listen for key information.  Tips!  Support every learner  In mixed-ability classes, put a few simple strategies in place so the whole class can listen to the same recording, and take part in the same activity. This means that no learner feels lost or left behind.   Make the gap-fill or sentence-completion task more achievable and supply the first letter of the missing word. Alternatively supply the first and the final letter and indicate how many letters the missing word has.  Provide an additional layer of support for weaker learners by giving them the audioscript. They can read the script as they listen and use it to help them find the correct answers.   Tips!  Prepare to listen, prepare to understand  Don be in too much of a hurry to hand out the listening task and press  Time spent in class before listening means learners are better prepared to understand.   Before you listen, have a class discussion around the topic of the listening. This gives learners the opportunity not only to practise their speaking, but also to practise listening to one another. A good discussion will make them think about the main ideas they might hear when they listen.  Useful vocabulary always comes out of a class discussion, creating a very natural way to pre-teach vocabulary before they listen. Useful language linked to a discussion is easier to learn because learners have a context, which makes it easier to remember than pre-teaching vocabulary from a wordlist.

        "question": "What strategies and activities are suggested by Cambridge English Qualifications to help learners develop effective reading skills?",
        "context": "What makes a good reader?   by   Chris Thorn ,  26/07/2021     Schools , Cambridge English Qualifications , Teaching      What makes a good reader? While reading a lot helps, it important to develop your learners strategies for reading effectively. Cambridge English Qualifications have been designed to help learners develop the different reading skills they need in the real world, progressing step by step from reading short simple texts to understanding complex texts and abstract ideas.  We have created five guides to developing reading skills with classroom activities for A2 Key for Schools , B1 Preliminary for Schools , B2 First for Schools , C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency . As well as providing familiarity with exam tasks, the teaching ideas, tips and strategies covered in these guides will help you feel more confident in teaching reading skills, as well as helping your learners to become better readers. Here we explore some of those teaching ideas and consider characteristics of a good reader.  Good readers  regularly read a wide range of texts  Reading a wide range helps readers quickly recognise what type of text they looking at, guess who wrote it, for whom and why  and predict where useful information is likely to be. As well as improving comprehension, this helps learners read more efficiently.  Activity  A fun way of helping learners recognise the features of different texts is  reading For example, use a short text from A2 Key for Schools or B1 Preliminary for Schools Reading Part 1. Let the learners look at the text for just a few seconds, then ask them to identify:   the type of text  who wrote it  for whom  the purpose of the text  what it about.   Ask learners to explain their answers before giving feedback. They may be surprised at how much they can tell from the layout alone.

        "context": "tell from the layout alone.  See a demonstration of this activity in the A2 Key for Schools teacher guide to developing reading skills , Part 1.  Good readers  use different skills  Good readers read texts in different ways, looking at the layout and headings, and reading quickly to get a general feel for the text (skimming), before reading more intensively or to find specific details (scanning).  Tip!  When setting up reading activities, explain which reading skills should be used for each task. Our guides tell you which skills you need to use in each exam task. For example, should learners read every word carefully, or try to locate specific information as quickly as possible? Elicit why. This increases learner awareness of different reading skills and when they are helpful.  Activity  Develop scanning skills by getting learners to find words in a competitive activity. Partners race against each other to find a word or piece of information to win points.   Pair learners carefully, ensuring they are of a similar reading level, and give them a text.  First ask them to scan quickly to find a specific word, then to find how many examples there are of a word that you choose in a text.  Increase the level of challenge by giving synonyms of words; e.g. if you want learners to find the word,  from the text, tell them to find a synonym of  smooth (B1),  exact (B1)  (B2) or  (C1).  Or give more general descriptions such as  a type of building or  a time  Use level-appropriate texts. For example, you can use texts from the sample tests for Cambridge English Qualifications.

Activity  Help learners identify key information about unknown words (which can help them make better guesses about their meaning) in this competitive, collaborative activity. Start by giving learners texts with some words blanked out. Groups work against the clock to identify as many ways of filling each gap as possible. They must justify their suggestions, ensuring they fit grammatically and make sense  award points accordingly.   Use level-appropriate texts. For example, you can use texts from our sample papers .  Get learners to challenge their classmates with their own gap-filled texts.   See an example of this activity in the B1 Preliminary for Schools teacher guide to developing reading skills , page 25.  Good readers  reflect on what they read  Good readers think about what they read and make a note of new vocabulary. Reflecting on what they liked, learned and want to know more about helps readers to make sense of a text, generating curiosity and motivation to read more.  Activity  Generate interest and guide reflection in this simple but effective pre- and post-reading activity. Ask learners to draw a simple table with four columns. Before they read, ask learners to note what they already know about a topic in the first column, before adding things they want to know in the second. As well as generating motivation to read, this provides teachers with lots of useful information about their learners.

        "context": "Mediation skills in the English language classroom   by   Cambridge English ,  29/09/2022     Classroom , Teaching , Research      We all have to take information, understand it, and then explain it to others. Although it may be second nature to many, it takes a unique set of skills to pull this off successfully. Perhaps you at university and your lecturer has asked you to look at an English research paper and summarise it to your study group in your home language. Or maybe you at work and you have taken a detailed safety brief that you have to relay back to colleagues. Other common examples that require these skills include explaining a timetable to a new class or just passing on the latest gossip!  A key skill for language learners  Taking information, summarising it, and passing it on is an example of what linguists call mediation, and it is a key skill for language learners at all levels. It the subject of the latest Cambridge Paper in ELT, Mediation: What it is, how to teach it and how to assess it which looks at some of the best strategies teachers can use to teach and assess mediation skills and have a lot of fun in the process.  Delia Kidd, Insight Application Manager, was part of the team that worked on the paper. She said:   is a fundamental skill that we use in our everyday lives and it essential for students who want to learn English for the real world. We see great examples in the workplace where employees are asked to take some complex information and then explain it to colleagues who are not experts. Another example could be young children taking on mediation roles when they on holiday by translating for their parents in restaurants.  The research paper follows a trend which is seeing the approach to teaching languages going beyond the traditional four skills of reading, writing, speaking, and listening to that of four modes of communication: reception, production, interaction, and mediation.

The recognition of mediation as a key skill for learning languages was given a further boost in 2020 when the Council of Europe published the Companion Volume for the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) . The CEFR is the international standard of language ability and the Companion Volume included a greater focus on mediation skills for teaching and learning.   good news for teachers is if they teaching real-life communication skills in the classroom, they probably already covering mediation skills, Kidd points out.  we recommend teachers can take this one step further by developing effective strategies for the classroom.  And how can teachers develop these strategies? A good starting point is to look at what mediation activities actually are. The CEFR describes them as:   mediating a text such as relaying specific information  mediating concepts such as communicating in a group  mediating communication such as acting as an intermediary in informal situations.   Teachers can then turn these ideas into practical classroom activities. For example, students can watch English-speaking news and films and then summarise the important points in English or their own language to the rest of the class.  Mediation and Cambridge English  Graham Seed, Senior Research Manager at Cambridge, was the author of the paper. He says mediation has been a big part of the Cambridge approach for several years:   Cambridge our courses already contain tasks aimed at teaching and developing mediation skills in the English language classroom.

Part of our series of Research Notes relevant for teachers preparing learners for Cambridge exams.  Periodic  checks of Cambridge English Qualifications (CEQs) are built into our quality assurance system for several reasons. First, we want to ensure the test is fit for purpose and the language skills we are assessing (the test construct) are still relevant to a changing society. Another reason for revision is that we are standardising the format of our exams to create greater uniformity and between them, enable upwards certification for strong performances, and help learners and teachers transition smoothly from one level CEFR to the next. This learning ladder then helps create a positive impact on teaching and learning beyond the test.  One significant change made in this cycle of revisions was to A2 Key Writing, which had had previously been assessed as part of the Reading paper. After consultation with both stakeholders and experts, we have now removed the spelling test which some teachers found difficult to relate to the curriculum and moved the open cloze to the reading section. We have also modified the writing task to assess performance at B1 level, and added a picture story task with appropriate support to allow learners to demonstrate narrative as well as transactional writing. In this way we are able to assess a broader range of writing skills and allow stronger students to demonstrate their ability and create positive washback on test preparation and student motivation.

The new Information for Candidates booklets are designed to give your learners all the information they need about their exam, but they are also a valuable teaching resource.  This blog post looks at four questions candidates often ask about their exam, with some helpful teaching ideas taken from these booklets.  What happens on exam day?  Knowing what to expect on exam day helps candidates to prepare and feel confident. Having a clear idea of what to bring and what happens when they step through the door helps candidates to focus on doing their best in their exam. The new Information for Candidates booklets have the answers to these questions.  Tip! In class, discuss exam-day routines. Share some of your own, for example getting lots of rest the night before, eating well, or the music you listen to. Ask learners to exchange ideas about what works for them, and what they expect to happen on the day of the exam. Watch a candidate exam-day experience and use the video to clarify anything learners are unsure of.  What the exam like and how should I approach it?  Exam knowledge is an important part of any preparation course. It helps candidates manage their time and choose the best ways to approach tasks in each paper.  Make sure you familiar with the exam. For example, the number of questions, the amount of time, how marks are awarded, the types of questions, texts, and the number of times each recording is heard.

You can use it in class by asking your students to think of all the different types of text they read in their own language, discussing what they enjoy reading most. For homework, ask them to find an article, book or blog, for example, in English on a topic they are interested in. Ask them to bring it to the next class, where they can talk about why they chose it and what they learned from it.  What happens next?  After the exam, encourage candidates to celebrate their success. This provides a sense of achievement.

        "question": "What are some key strategies to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment for learners with dyslexia?",
        "context": "10 ways to support learners with dyslexia   by   Jade Blue ,  20/04/2021     Teaching , Classroom , Schools      Cambridge English Qualifications are designed to be accessible to all learners, including those with dyslexia. Dyslexia is a learning difficulty that mainly affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent reading and spelling. Learning difficulties are not related to a person intelligence but are caused by differences in the ways the brain processes information. They vary greatly from person to person. Dyslexia mainly affects the development of literacy and language-related skills, and learners with dyslexia are likely to have problems with phonological processing, working memory and processing speed.  Key terminology   Phonological processing: using sounds (phonemes) to process spoken and written language.  Working memory: the amount of information that can be held in mind and used in doing tasks.  Processing speed: the pace at which we take in information, make sense of it and begin to respond.   Developing inclusive and supportive learning environments  The challenges for learners with dyslexia vary from person to person, so the focus of teaching should be on making the learning environment as inclusive and supportive as possible. Inclusion is,  sense of belonging: feeling respected, valued for who you are; feeling a level of supportive energy and commitment from others so that you can do your best work (Miller & Katz 2002).  Here are 10 ways to develop an inclusive learning environment. They include planning inclusive lessons, and carrying out assessment and feedback, to help learners with dyslexia prepare for their Cambridge English Qualification with confidence.  1. Create a supportive and collaborative classroom culture  Create a supportive and collaborative classroom culture by getting to know all your learners as individuals and encouraging them to get to know each other.

        "context": "collaborative classroom culture by getting to know all your learners as individuals and encouraging them to get to know each other. This will help learners feel comfortable thinking about ways to do tasks and asking for support.  2. Use multisensory input and activities  Use multisensory input and activities to give learners more than one way to make connections and learn concepts. For example, use flash cards, puppets, story videos and real objects in the classroom. When learners use more than one sense at a time, their brain is stimulated in a variety of ways. Multisensory activities may involve a combination of reading, listening, viewing, touching an object, moving physically around the space, or using gesture.  3. Offer learners choices  Offer learners choices in how they engage with tasks to make learning more meaningful and inclusive. For example, learners might  rather than write notes during a listening task or while preparing for a speaking task.  4. Have L-shaped cards available  Have L-shaped cards available for learners to frame sections of textbook pages and help focus their attention. Encourage learners to use a plain piece of paper to cover reading texts and reveal one line at a time as they read. These are useful techniques for all learners when you are teaching reading skills.  5. Present new language in small and manageable chunks  Present new language in small and manageable chunks so that you don overload learners. Focus on key language from the exam wordlists and the language specifications in the teacher handbook.  6. Spend some time explicitly teaching exam strategies  Spend some time explicitly teaching exam strategies, such as how to approach particular tasks in the exam, and break these down into a series of simple steps.  7. Use concept-checking questions  Use concept-checking questions (CCQs) to check your learners understanding of a new word or grammatical item. CCQs are better than just asking  you understand?

Example CCQs for the adjective quick might be:  things do you know that are quick?  the opposite of quick? or  snails quick? You could also use pictures of objects or gestures to check your learners understanding.  8. Offer lots of opportunities for learners to recap and review language  Offer lots of opportunities for learners to recap and review language, especially from the exam wordlists. Use varied techniques to help learners memorise new words, including drawing, music or rhythm, movement, gesture and visualisation techniques.  9. Try different approaches to giving feedback  Talk to your learners about what type of feedback works best for them. Remember that hearing the teacher voice can feel more personal and supportive than receiving written feedback in red pen, so try making a short video or voice recording with your comments.  10. Remember that assessment should be ongoing  Remember that assessment should be ongoing and isn the end of the learning process. If you give something back to a learner to correct, make sure you check the next version and then give them feedback on this too. The challenges that learners with dyslexia experience often lead to low levels of confidence, so remember to include positive feedback to encourage learners and build self-esteem.

        "context": "Five ways a CELTA qualification will further your career   by   Cambridge English ,  02/11/2023     Teaching , Teaching qualifications , Professional development      There are many reasons why people choose to become an English language teacher. Some want to make a difference in other people lives. Some want to travel, live in new countries and immerse themselves in a new culture. Others want to work with children, or do a creative, interesting job. Whatever your motivations, you be sure to meet fascinating students and help them develop valuable new skills.  But choosing the right English language teaching course for you can be a challenge. There are so many different TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) courses to pick from.  Here are five reasons why we recommend taking an official Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (CELTA) qualification from Cambridge.  1. Employment opportunities  Finding the right English language teaching jobs can be difficult, whether or not you have professional experience.  The right qualification can give you an advantage. However, there are many kinds of TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) courses available. An online search reveals weekend short courses, online courses, courses that only go into theory, and courses that include observed teaching practice.  Unofficial courses are of varying quality. Some may have very good programmes, but they are not standardised and there is no external moderation. Future employers won know if your course has really prepared you for the job.  That why it important you choose an accredited qualification. CELTA is certified by Cambridge and regulated by Ofqual, the government office that regulates qualifications in England.  2.

        "context": "in the world  CELTA is recognised and trusted by language academies and educational institutions everywhere. This means that, unlike many unaccredited courses, it will help you to build your career whether you hoping to work at home or abroad.  A 2018 study of 600 English language teaching job adverts in over 60 countries revealed that CELTA is the qualification most often requested by employers. In fact, three out of four English language teaching jobs specify CELTA.  So whether you looking to teach online from your home, work in a local institution, or teach English while you travel the world, CELTA can help.  3. Rigorous training  If you are serious about becoming an English language teacher, you know it takes more than just being able to speak the language. It requires lesson planning, an understanding of grammar and vocabulary, teaching skills, classroom management, and the ability to work with a wide range of ages and abilities.  A 120-hour CELTA qualification offers rigorous training. Unlike many less in-depth courses, it will also provide you with the tools you need to continue learning autonomously, even after you completed your qualification.  Alongside the training and support from your tutors, an additional 80 hours of self-study is included in the course. This will enable you to learn at your own pace and engage in self-reflection  an important part of developing as a teacher.  Experienced teachers will also benefit from a CELTA qualification. CELTA focus on practical classroom activities and communicative language teaching complements your existing knowledge. What more, the feedback on your teaching practice can really help you hone your skills  helping you do an even better job for your learners.  4.

Your trainers will give you in-depth feedback on your lesson plans and how you can improve delivery. By passing the course, you clearly demonstrate to future employers that you have the knowledge and skills it takes to deliver effective and engaging language classes.  Why is this important? As Luke Worsnop of CELTA training school Oxford TEFL explains,  employers don accept courses lacking an observed teaching element  Unaccredited teacher training courses do not have a standardised level of training. While you may have an excellent instructor on your course, it also possible they lack experience and qualifications.  At the very least, CELTA trainers must have a Level 7 or equivalent qualification, e.g. a Master in TESOL, or a DELTA. They have also been through an in-depth training programme. Standards are monitored closely by Cambridge and all courses are moderated.  5. Career progression  CELTA is the perfect way to start your English language teaching career, or to improve on the teaching skills you already acquired.  It will enable you to take on a range of different roles as an English language teacher and even step into new areas of interest. For example, if you are considering staying in TEFL for the long term, you might also be interested in moving into teacher training, management, materials writing or another position in the industry.  Offering a firm foundation in teaching methodology, CELTA will also pave the way for further qualifications.

A learner who communicates a lot while making a few mistakes is much more likely to develop confidence for dealing with real-life situations than a learner who communicates very little because they afraid of making any. In communicative language teaching, for example, the teacher is tasked with both encouraging the learner to express themselves and with providing corrective feedback in a way that is not obstructive to communication (e.g. Brandl 2008).  This means that if a learner says,  go swimming last night, it is much more effective to respond with,  that nice, you went swimming. What did you do after? rather than,  You went swimming! Use past simple for past events!  the former encourages the learner to continue their narrative while the latter is much more likely to make the learner stop in their tracks, re-evaluate the context, and think twice before expressing themselves again in the future, for the fear of making a mistake again. Teachers need to be careful not to parrot back everything the students say in this manner, of course, but the technique can be an effective method of acknowledging the content of a student response, while also providing feedback on accuracy.

        "context": "everything the students say in this manner, of course, but the technique can be an effective method of acknowledging the content of a student response, while also providing feedback on accuracy.  The importance of the freedom to make mistakes in language learning is also supported by research in psychology, which suggests that learners who try a task without having mastered it completely experience improved retention of new information (e.g. Kornell et al 2009, Moser et al 2011). A similar experiment in the context of language learning also indicates that the process of making mistakes activates a greater network of related knowledge in the brain, which leads to superior learning outcomes (Guzm 2020).  Top tips for helping learners  make mistakes!  In Cambridge English, we believe that the key to helping learners feel relaxed and ready for communicating freely in the classroom is authenticity. This means that there should be both a real communicative need for a learner to speak and the authentic reaction from those around to what the learner has said.  Let look at how this works in our new language-learning world in Minecraft . There a dwarf called Hungry who asks the player for some fruit. The player of course responds to Hungry not because they will get a mark from their teacher for it, but because they want to progress through the game, and because Hungry is nice and there also an alluring vending machine full of treats nearby! Just like in real life, the player is free to choose whatever they like from the vending machine. There isn a low mark for buying the wrong item. Instead, Hungry rewards the player with more language, pronouncing the name of the food item he brought, and sending the player back to try again.   Here are a few ways of how such authentic communicative interactions can be practised in the classroom:   surround learners with the English language  encourage them to speak to you and each other in English  don worry about diverging from topics",

        "context": "interactions can be practised in the classroom:   surround learners with the English language  encourage them to speak to you and each other in English  don worry about diverging from topics that are not strictly covered in your lesson plan  sometimes the best communication is spontaneous  model communication by telling your students stories and anecdotes about your own life and encourage them to do the same  let your learners have fun with English  give them colloquial expressions to try and ask them to share some expressions that they heard or seen elsewhere  do not overcorrect  if an error is recurring, make a note of it and cover it in subsequent lessons  avoid the temptation to turn what was intended as speaking practice into a full-on grammar lesson.   While easier said than done, especially when the outcome of an exam is at stake, it is worth remembering that Cambridge English examiners, just like the people that our learners might come to interact with outside of the classroom, are driven by the natural desire to understand the people they communicate with. This is especially powerful when practised in the context of a classroom  via role-playing activities or language-learning experiences like the one we built in Minecraft. They set the learners up for success in real-life communication. In other words, when communication is the goal, mistakes are secondary, and that real life, isn it?  Explore our Minecraft world!

        "question": "What are the benefits of giving learners a mock test, and when is the ideal time to run one during a course?",
        "context": "How to help your learners feel prepared for exam day   by   Rebecca Norris ,  03/06/2021     Schools , Classroom , Cambridge English Qualifications , Teaching      What is a mock test?  A mock test is sometimes called a practice test. It helps prepare learners for an exam they intend to take in the future. The goal is that the procedures, timings and question papers should be as similar to the real exam as possible, so on exam day learners know exactly what to expect.  Why give learners a mock test?  A mock test helps both you and your learners identify specific strengths and areas to work on.  It can help manage learners expectations too. Learners who don do as well as they expected often become more motivated to study; those who do better than they expected get a confidence boost.  Running a mock test is also a great way for teachers to learn more about the exam. Reading the information guides and working with the marking criteria helps you get an understanding of what the examiners are looking for. It also helps with useful exam strategies to teach your learners.  When should I run a mock test?  Running a mock test around the middle of your course works well because learners need time to prepare before they do a test. Your aim should be to build your learners confidence by showing them what they already know as well as what they need to work on.  Bear in mind that the test might need to be spread over two classes or more depending on your teaching schedule. For example, the A2 Key for Schools exam takes just over 90 minutes but C2 Proficiency is almost 4 hours long.  Finally, the key to getting the most benefit from the mock test is to allow sufficient time for learners to absorb and act on feedback once you hand back their papers.

        "question": "What is the importance of considering the test takers' characteristics when designing an assessment, and how might this influence the types of tasks included in the test?",
        "context": "What is Validity?   by   Evelina Galaczi ,  17/07/2020     Teaching , Cambridge English Qualifications , Assessment      What is Validity?  The fundamental concept to keep in mind when creating any assessment is validity. Validity refers to whether a test measures what it aims to measure. For example, a valid driving test should include a practical driving component and not just a theoretical test of the rules of driving. A valid language test for university entry, for example, should include tasks that are representative of at least some aspects of what actually happens in university settings, such as listening to lectures, giving presentations, engaging in tutorials, writing essays, and reading texts.  Validity has different elements, which we are now going to look at in turn.  Test Purpose  Why am I testing?  We can never really say that a test is valid or not valid. Instead, we can say that a test is valid for a particular purpose. There are several reasons why you might want to test your students. You could be trying to check their learning at the end of a unit, or trying to understand what they know and don know. Or, you might want to use a test to place learners into groups based on their ability, or to provide test takers with a certificate of language proficiency. Each of these different reasons for testing represents a different test purpose.  The purpose of the test determines the type of test you going to produce, which in turn affects the kinds of tasks you going to choose, the number of test items, the length of the test, and so on. For example, a test certifying that doctors can practise in an English-speaking country would be different from a placement test which aims to place those doctors into language courses.  Test Takers  Who am I testing?  It also vital to keep in mind who is taking your test. Is it primary school children or teenagers or adults? Or is it airline pilots or doctors or engineers? This is an important question because the test",

        "context": "vital to keep in mind who is taking your test. Is it primary school children or teenagers or adults? Or is it airline pilots or doctors or engineers? This is an important question because the test has to be appropriate for the test takers it is aimed for. If your test takers are primary school children, for instance, you might want to give them more interactive tasks or games to test their language ability. If you are testing listening skills, for example, you might want to use role plays for doctors, but lectures or monologues with university students.  Test Construct  What am I testing?  Another key point is to consider what you want to test. Before designing a test, you need to identify the ability or skill that the test is designed to measure  in technical terms, the  construct Some examples of constructs are: intelligence, personality, anxiety, English language ability, pronunciation. To take language assessment as an example, the test construct could be communicative language ability, or speaking ability, or perhaps even a construct as specific as pronunciation. The challenge is to define the construct and find ways to elicit it and measure it; for example, if we are testing the construct of fluency, we might consider features such as rate of speech, number of pauses/hesitations and the extent to which any pauses/hesitations cause strain for a listener.  Test Tasks  How am I testing?  Once you defined what you want to test, you need to decide how you going to test it. The focus here is on selecting the right test tasks for the ability (i.e. construct) you interested in testing. All task types have advantages and limitations and so it important to use a range of tasks in order to minimize their individual limitations and optimize the measurement of the ability you interested in. The tasks in a test are like a menu of options that are available to choose from, and you must be sure to choose the right task or the right range of tasks for the ability you trying",

The tasks in a test are like a menu of options that are available to choose from, and you must be sure to choose the right task or the right range of tasks for the ability you trying to measure.  Test Reliability - How am I scoring?  Next it important to consider how to score your test. A test needs to be reliable and to produce accurate scores. So, you need to make sure that the scores from a test reflect a learner actual ability. In deciding how to score a test, you need to consider whether the answers to the are going to be scored as correct or incorrect (this might be the case for multiple tasks, for example) or whether you might use a range of marks and give partial credit, as for example, in reading or listening comprehension questions. In speaking and writing, you also have to decide what criteria to use (for example, grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, essay, organisation in writing, and so on). You also need to make sure that the teachers involved in speaking or writing assessment have received some training, so that they are marking to (more or less) the same standard.  Test Impact - How will my test help learners?  The final  and in many ways most important  question to ask yourself is how the test is benefitting learners. Good tests engage learners in situations similar to ones that they might face outside the classroom (i.e. authentic tasks), or which provide useful feedback or help their language development by focusing on all four skills (reading, listening, writing, speaking). For example, if a test has a speaking component, this will encourage speaking practice in the classroom. And if that speaking test includes both language production (e.g. describe a picture) and interaction (e.g. discuss a topic with another student), then preparing for the test encourages the use of a wide range of speaking activities in the classroom and enhances learning.",

Even before the Covid-19 crisis, a survey by the QS Intelligence Unit suggested that students see employment prospects as the most important benefit of attending an internationally-recognised university, far ahead of other benefits such as quality of education or the student experience. 1  Employability is likely to be an even more important factor after the crisis, as students prepare for an increasingly competitive labour market. With graduate jobs in short supply, the insecurity of the  economy and the awareness that more and more professions will be affected by automation, prospective students need to know that their education will give them the skills they need for success.  Tomorrow skills  We often say that as educators we are preparing students for careers that don yet exist, but it is clear that tomorrow professions will require a wide range of social, cognitive and emotional skills, which will be essential for success in any career.  To help identify these skills Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Assessment have developed the Employability Skills Framework .

Cambridge English Qualifications  especially but not limited to B2 First, C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency  are designed to help students to get the maximum possible benefit from their studies in further and higher education. They are known world-wide as an excellent way to prepare students for many of the tasks they will face at university, such as listening to lectures, writing essays, understanding by reading across multiple texts, and giving presentations. But beyond that, they also ensure that successful candidates have work-ready language skills that will help them in the transition from education to work and professional development.

As part of that evolution, this framework has been developed to help explain clearly to teachers and their employers how our teaching qualifications map onto a core syllabus of competencies and how teachers are supported by our increased range of professional development opportunities.  Aim of the framework  The Cambridge English Teaching Framework has been designed to encapsulate the key knowledge and skills needed for effective teaching at a variety of levels and in different contexts. It aims to:   help teachers to identify where they are in their professional career  help teachers and their employers to think about where to go next and identify development activities to get there.   The framework describes teacher competencies across four stages, and five aspects of teacher knowledge and skill (categories), and is a profiling grid rather than a performance assessment tool (see North 2009). It is intended to show stages of a teacher development at any one point in time, rather than provide a description of  good teacher This approach recognises that teachers development over time is not predictable or defined by years of experience only, and that most teachers development will be  (Rossner 2009:5), in that, across the categories, teachers will be at different stages at any one time.

These include assessors reports of lesson observations on pre-service (CELTA) and in-service (ICELT and Delta) courses, as well as detailed background documents in the form of assignments (CELTA and ICELT) and portfolios of work (ICELT and Delta) which demonstrate the processes that teachers go through when planning and reflecting on their teaching. This unique resource has provided us with detailed descriptions of classroom practice at different stages of teachers careers. Equally importantly, these assessment reports reflect the realities of teaching and learning in many different contexts, which are in turn reflected in the design of the framework. The development of the framework has also been informed by theory, in particular a wide-ranging review of current teacher education literature, as well as input by external consultants. This research-based approach has been complemented by the parallel development of an edited volume on assessment in teacher education Assessing language teachers professional skills and knowledge in the series  in Language Testing (Wilson and Poulter, forthcoming). The levels and categories of the framework have also been informed by a review of the CELTA, ICELT and Delta syllabuses, which are themselves supported by a substantial body of information about their application in practice from the statistical analysis of both candidate information and examination results, and the detailed annual reports by the Chief Assessors and Chief Moderators for each qualification.

Teaching, Learning and Assessment  Planning language learning. Lesson planning (individual and series of lessons) is a key teaching competency, and is included in most teacher training programmes.

Language Ability: It is acknowledged that a certain level of language ability is required in order to teach language effectively, as well as to communicate with other professionals as appropriate; however, any minimum language level required of the teacher is likely to vary depending on the teaching context and language levels of the group of learners being taught (see CEFR levels for guidance on language proficiency).

Professional Development and Values: Professional development is widely viewed as creating a platform for teacher learning (Harmer 2007), and it is generally accepted that reflective skills are key in enabling teachers to evaluate their teaching and identify areas for improvement (Korthagen 2001, Richards & Farrell 2005, Russell 2005).

A range of these different research activities has also been shown to be valuable in promoting teacher learning (Borg 2013; Wallace 1996). The role of a teacher in the 21st century is increasingly seen as involving the ability to work in a team and collaborate with colleagues and also to work within an institution taking on different roles and responsibilities where necessary (Darling-Hammond 2006; Freeman et al 2009; Leung 2009).

While factors such as specific qualifications obtained, training undertaken, number of hours/years of formal teaching experience or degree of language proficiency are all important, they may not necessarily be directly related to a particular level of competence and are, therefore, not specified in the framework as such.   Stages in the framework  There is no support in the literature on teacher expertise for a definite number of stages or levels of teacher development; indeed, it is widely accepted that learning to teach is ongoing and there is no  competence (Graves 2009). However, the four stages identified for the framework  Foundation, Developing, Proficient and Expert  map a  developmental trajectory (Graves 2009) and reflect the career development of many teachers as well as their self-assessments of their own competence. Despite the lack of consensus as to what defines different stages of teacher development (Katz & Snow 2009, Murray 2001), research into  expertise does suggest noticeable differences between  and  teachers: with  being more concerned with control, while  have more developed routines (Tsui 2003, 2009). Studies of  and  teachers suggest that teacher expertise involves the development of schemata/routines based on extensive experience of classrooms and learners, which  teachers rely on unconsciously for much of their instructional decisions (Bereiter & Scardamalia 1993; Tsui 2003).  A central point to emerge from recent teacher cognition research is that teachers thinking and behaviour are guided by a set of personal, practical, systematic, dynamic and often unconscious beliefs (Borg 2006). This suggests that  process of learning to teach is not a linear accrual of various aspects of teaching, but rather a gradual process of proceduralising aspects of formal and experiential knowledge gained from teacher education and classroom experience mediated by beliefs and contextual constraints",

A detailed teacher profile has been developed to exemplify each of the levels across each of the four categories and 36 components of the framework.

It is not surprising that by the end of the week, we feel exhausted, yet still have a mountain of students work to mark by Monday. According to research from the Education Policy Unit, most full-time teachers work an average of 48.2 hours per week with many working as many as 60 hours per week. Does this sound like you?  The BIG question is  can there really be a way to make sustainable changes that allow us to have more time for ourselves without sacrificing our students progress or feeling guilty, and maybe even helping our students be more motivated and more successful in the long run?  It seems ironic that with students not attending school around the world during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many teachers have reported that they are even more stressed and working even longer hours in order to help their students as much as possible.  It has been an incredibly difficult time for teachers and students alike. This situation is also set to continue for some of us or we may see a generalised long-term shift to blended learning, with some lessons taught face to face in classrooms and others online. Despite the challenges and the stress of having to teach online, I believe there are some very helpful lessons to take away from this experience that will not only allow teachers to better manage their time in their future, but also benefit students.  Here are some practical ideas to help you manage your time:   Make use of online resources.

These materials are designed to support different students needs and, most importantly, cut out the need for teachers to monitor and mark work as   Encourage learners to work independently. Students independent study can be more focused on their needs and interests as well as be level appropriate. We all know that any class of students are never all at the same level with the same strengths and weaknesses. Where class activities cannot meet all their needs at the same time, personalised individual learning online can. It is important for teachers to realise that letting go of control over what is taught is not necessarily a bad thing and that students will actually benefit from accepting more responsibility for their own learning.  Focus classroom time on communication and collaboration. Some tasks do belong in the classroom and it important to exploit them fully. Tasks that require and develop communication skills and collaboration should be at the heart of the classroom experience and these are the tasks where most of the work done is by students not teachers.

        "question": "How do video games support the building blocks of effective learning, and what role does a strong narrative play in this process?",
        "context": "How do video games provide effective learning   by   Maija Kozlova ,  19/05/2021     Research , Language , Technology      There are five broadly defined prerequisites for effective learning: meaningful context, authenticity, motivation, freedom to make mistakes, and learner autonomy. Cambridge English teaching and learning materials harness the power of meaningful context and authenticity by presenting new language in a way that creates a genuine need to interact and communicate. And, as all teachers would attest, learners are most successful when they are motivated, free to learn from their mistakes, and take ownership of their own learning process.  So what do video games have to do with this? Well, in addition to the known benefits of games , video games support each of the building blocks of effective learning by providing:   a strong and engaging narrative (context)  purposeful interactions (authenticity)  emotional engagement (motivation)  freedom to fail (mistakes)  opportunities for independent decision making (learner autonomy).   Context  A strong narrative  Context is the glue that helps us connect new information to what we already know about the world. This is why when we learn a language, we cover a series of topics like family, hobbies or holidays, instead of learning all of the words in the order that they appear in a dictionary starting with A and ending with Z. Without appropriate context, new information has nothing to attach itself to in our brain and becomes almost impossible to remember.  Video games set excellent context by providing a strong and engaging narrative, a story. Humans are wired to connect with stories. A strong narrative is compelling because it triggers an emotional response, which in turn makes it memorable. That why storytelling is such a powerful tool in marketing, politics, business and media.

It was delicious, thank you! when they bring her back a cup of coffee, rewarding the player with some more authentic language used in context.   Motivation  Emotional engagement  There a direct link between learner motivation and learning outcomes in and outside the classroom. Engaged learners are focused and curious, and generally do better than those who are disinterested or distracted. Video games are very good at leveraging the story, the challenges and the rewards within the game to trigger emotional response which is directly linked to motivation.  Inside our game in Minecraft, learners are motivated to solve the language puzzles because it ensures their progress within the game. They encouraged to persevere in their learning, both by the environment and the characters they meet. Players can choose which parts to pay most attention to, but they can avoid it. The language is built into the interactions within the game. To progress, players have no choice but to communicate  in English!   Mistakes help you learn  Freedom to fail  It might seem counter-intuitive, but when learning a language, mistakes can be beneficial when learners are given an opportunity to notice and reflect on them in a safe environment. Video games are excellent at providing plenty of safe opportunities to practise. In our Minecraft game, for example, players are free to wander off the wrong way or spell a word wrong. Instead of losing marks or progress, each mistake will result in more language input, to nudge learners towards the solution. This freedom to fail in video games is key to uninhibited language practice and is fundamental to our Adventures in English with Cambridge.

Whether you just starting out or thinking of a career change, teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) is one of the most rewarding professional journeys you can embark on.  In English language teaching (ELT), there is a lot of career potential. As you develop your skills and take on more responsibilities, you can enjoy a long-term career. Many ELT professionals become senior teachers or teacher trainers, or move into management or materials writing.  In this blog post, we outline why teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) is such an exciting job and offer advice on how you can get started.  Why become an English language teacher?  There are lots of reasons you might want to become an English language teacher. For a start, you can make a real difference in people lives. According to a 2019 survey by Wall Street English , 18% of professionals who have learned English report that they feel happier at work; 12% say they feel happier in general; and half of English speakers earn 25% more because of their language skills.  Moreover, English language teaching is an immensely flexible profession. You can decide whether to take a public or private job, or offer lessons on your own. Your working conditions are flexible too. You might prefer to work in a local school or academy, but many English language teaching jobs also allow you to work online from home.

You spend your day with interesting, engaging people who are keen to learn. What could be better than that?  What do English language teachers do every day?  It probably goes without saying that language educators teach students English on a day-to-day basis. But there are plenty of other aspects to the job as well.  English language teachers assess their learners through quick tests and official exams. They use this information to define learning objectives, and then plan courses and classes that meet their students needs.  Language teachers use a range of coursebooks and English language teaching materials, including a variety of audio, visual and digital tools. At the same time, they find and create teaching and learning materials of their own.  In the process of developing learners reading, listening, speaking and writing abilities, teachers also help students develop confidence in presenting and communicating ideas. Furthermore, language teachers encourage students to develop important 21st century skills, such as creativity, collaboration, leadership, autonomous learning and adaptability. These skills are transferable and will help learners in many areas throughout their lives.  What do you need to become an English language teacher?  Being a good English teacher requires more than just being able to speak the language fluently.

There are opportunities to teach the English language almost everywhere. For example, you can teach English in an English-speaking country such as the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand or Ireland. You find many private and public programmes and classes for people who have come to work or study, and who need to improve their English.  Alternatively, you can teach English in schools and universities in countries where English is the official language  but not always how people communicate on a daily basis.

Exams give students something to aim for and help them develop the skills they need in their lives, education and the workplace.  Teachers everywhere want to see their students do well. So how can you motivate them to get started and support them as they approach exam day?  In this article, we guide you through five exam preparation tips to help your students build their confidence and ensure they feel fully prepared.  1. Give your students manageable goals  SMART goals help students make progress by being specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. They help students imagine what they want to achieve and  by breaking down objectives into steps  help them understand how they are progressing. Cambridge English Qualifications are designed with this in mind, and the regular goals motivate students to improve their skills step by step.  In addition, these goals are useful when thinking about short, medium and long-term objectives  and can be used throughout individual classes, each term and the academic year.  Here are some questions to answer when planning your curriculum and preparing your classes:   What are my students learning needs? (Relevant)  What do I want my students to achieve this year/term/class? (Specific and Time-bound)  Is this level-appropriate and what support do I need to give them? (Achievable)  How will I/they know they are making progress? (Measurable)   Example SMART goals  Short term: By the end of the lesson, I will be able to ask and answer basic questions about what I like doing.  Medium term: By the end of the term, I will have improved my test scores in the Reading and Writing sections of A2 Key for Schools.  Long term: By the end of the year, I will have passed A2 Key for Schools and started preparing for B1",

Goals checklist  For young learners, a goals checklist can be an effective way to help them focus on their goals, remember what they have done and reflect on their progress. In the example below, students simply need to tick off what they achieved.  For lower levels, it might be helpful to write the goals and instructions in the students first language.

Make sure you help students practise in a number of ways  incorporating exam-style activities in the classroom, setting practice tests for homework and running a mock exam. You should also consider testing students on their knowledge of the structure and timings of the exams too.

Check in with students regularly  It always a good idea to find out how well your students are getting on with the activities you are doing in class. There are a number of simple resources you can use to help students feel supported and confident.  Traffic light cards  Traffic light cards give students of all ages an opportunity to show you how they feel about their progress in any given lesson. Provide students with green, amber and red cards.   Green = Okay, I understand!  Amber = I might need a little help.  Red = Stop! I need some help.   You can either ask students to hold them up during the lesson at specific times  this allows you to assess how well they are doing  or you can have them hold up their cards whenever they need help. You can also ask learners to display them on their tables during group work  this will help you see who needs the most help while you are monitoring.  Exit tickets  For older or more advanced students try exit tickets. Near the end of the lesson, hand out the tickets and give the students a few minutes to reflect on the lesson. These will help you measure individual and whole-class progress. You know what students are confident with and what they need to work on, which can help you with your planning. It also a good chance for shyer students to ask for support without drawing attention to themselves.  Download an exit ticket template  5.

        "question": "Why is it important for teachers to have clear and constructive communication channels with parents or carers in the context of young learner and teenage education?",
        "context": "The seven Cs of effective communication   by   Cambridge English ,  18/03/2021     Schools , Teaching      Helping teachers talk to parents about A2 Key for Schools, B1 Preliminary for Schools and B2 First for Schools  When we think of the people involved in teaching and learning, we tend to think of the teachers and the learners. Yet, in the context of young learner and teenage education this leaves out a very important stakeholder  the parents or carers!  Parents have a very keen interest in what happens with the learning of the children in their care. As a teacher, having open and constructive channels of communication with parents is essential. Having an effective strategy to bring them into the classroom and the learning process is very often the key to success.  Follow our seven-point checklist when you plan, write and revise your communications. It will help you explain to parents exactly what you need them to know so they become your partners in their child learning journey.  1. Clear  It is important to be clear about our aim and message when we are communicating with someone. Clear communication explains complicated ideas in ways that you can understand using simple and familiar language. It leaves no doubts or ambiguity about the purpose of the communication.  Tip: Start with a list of the things that you need parents to know, agree to or understand. Then eliminate anything on the list that you think they will not be familiar with. Do they know what  competence or  on the CEFR mean? Probably not  so don include it!  2. Concrete  Once you have removed jargon, how do you fill in the gaps? Good communication is essential: your challenge is to find a new way to say these things that gives a clear and specific picture. An explanation can help, but an image or a comparison is even better!  Tip: Imagine that learners are football players  we want them to know the rules of the game, but we are not interested in how well they can recite them. Instead, we want to",

        "question": "How can teachers effectively demonstrate learner competence to parents while maintaining a concise and considerate communication style?",
        "context": "is even better!  Tip: Imagine that learners are football players  we want them to know the rules of the game, but we are not interested in how well they can recite them. Instead, we want to see how they use them in a real match, and how they can use them to solve the problems they face on the pitch. That is what we call competence.  3. Concise  Stick to the point. Be brief. This shows respect for our audience (you appreciate that their time is valuable), but it also helps to keep us clear and precise.  A good example of concise information is the Can Do statements that we use to describe learner competence. When we say that a B1 Preliminary candidate  understand routine information and articles and  understand straightforward instructions or public announcements we create a simple image.  Tip: The descriptors in our handbooks for teachers will give you plenty of examples ready for when you talk to parents about what their child CAN do at each level. Search to find all our resources for teachers .  4. Considerate  Tone and register are important. Too formal and you will come across as distant and unapproachable; too casual and you will not sound professional. Consider the age, style and expectations of the parents  look at yourself through their eyes and meet their expectations.  Tip: Imagine what the parents will ask you about their child progress and prepare what you are going to say. You could use the results of homework or practice tests to show parents how their child is progressing and that they are ready to take an exam.  5. Coherent  Coherent communication is about being logical and effective. A good argument must feel like the shortest, easiest line from idea A to idea B  no detours and no gaps. If you are talking about why taking an exam at the end of a course is important, be sure that all your points are connected and relevant to your main argument.  Tip: For example, you could structure your points as follows:  national curriculum says that by the end",

Tip: For example, you could structure your points as follows:  national curriculum says that by the end of secondary school learners should reach a B2 level of English. It is very important for the school and the families to feel confident that our students are on track to meet that very important goal. Taking a Cambridge English Qualification is an excellent way to increase their confidence. We recommend that your child takes A2 Key for Schools and B1 Preliminary for Schools at the end of years 2 and 4.  6. Correct  Correct communication is appropriate and error free  especially in writing. This includes proofreading, but also making sure that any details (such as names of exams, dates and addresses) are correct and consistent throughout your message.  Tip: It helps to have a second, fresh pair of eyes. Ask a colleague who does not know what you are trying to communicate to read the message, highlight any issues and then explain it back to you. If they can do it, then the parents can too!  7. Complete  Good communication will tell parents everything that they need to know, and also what they are expected to do next. Have you ticked all the items on the list in the tip in the first point? If you need parents to do something, did you mention exactly what it is?  Tip: Remember the Rule of Three. No message is complete unless you have mentioned the main ideas three times: once at the introduction ( am going to tell you about B1 Preliminary then in the development ( is what you need to know about B1 Preliminary and once more at the end ( that you know this about B1 Preliminary, remember to   Learn more about how you can talk to parents about their child progress in our recent webinar for teachers by Pablo Toledo.

        "question": "What are some strategies suggested for giving instructions effectively in an online lesson for young learners, according to the Cambridge English article?",
        "context": "Four challenges in teaching young learners online   by   Cambridge English ,  24/08/2020     Teaching , Technology , Young learners       Teaching young learners online can be challenging. Here are some helpful tips to keep your students engaged during your online lessons.  Challenge one: Giving instructions in an online lesson   You may not be able to see your students reactions as clearly as in a face-to-face classroom to see if they can understand what you saying.  Problems with connectivity might mean students miss parts of the instruction too. Without a friend sitting next to them to check what you said, students could get lost quite quickly.   Solutions:  Use activities that your students are already familiar with and have done before. If you use sample tasks from Pre A1 Starters, A1 Movers and A2 Flyers , this also helps them feel more prepared for the exam.  Think about how you give your instructions:   Ask questions to check that your students have understood what they have to do, and always do an example of an activity before starting it.  Can you write the instructions on your presentation so students can read what they have to do as well as listen to you?  Check that students understand in their first language, particularly if they are quite young or a low level.   For more ideas on giving instructions and teaching young learners online, watch our webinar Teaching English online to young learners  which is full of tips and activities.  Activities take longer to prepare and longer to teach  Activities tend to take longer when teaching online as you have to allow time for any technical problems, and for checking all your students can see and hear you.  Solutions:  Don try to fit too much into each lesson. Have one clear aim and keep your lesson simple! Think about short activities that vary in pace to help you reach that aim.

Rather than nominating individual students to give their answers which can be time consuming and also make students anxious, show the answers on the screen for students to check themselves.  To give you some support and help you cut down on your planning time, we created lesson plans to cover every task in the Pre A1 Starters, A1 Movers and A2 Flyers exams. These complete lesson plans are designed to cover a 45 minute  1 hour lesson but can be easily adapted to suit your needs. Download them from the Teacher Resource Finder .  Students get distracted easily  Unlike in the classroom, you have no control over the environment students are joining the lesson from. There are many reasons they might get distracted during their online lessons. Solutions:  Involve students in the lessons as much as possible! Talk to all of the students and use their names when talking to them.  Give them a physical task and change the pace of the lesson to get their attention back. You could ask them to show you something that in the room where they are or tell them to hold up something of a certain colour or to  if This is a good way to involve students without them having to talk, to check their understanding of something or to share their answers to a task.  Another way to involve students and keep them engaged is to have them make their own flashcards to hold up. Have a look at our A2 Flyers Reading and Writing Part 4 lesson plan (optional extension, p4) for an example of how to do this. Finally, grab their attention with a song!

Teachers talks too much or students don talk enough  Pair work and group work can seem more challenging to set up in an online lesson, meaning the teacher can end up talking a lot more than in a face to face lesson. However pair work and group work is still possible, you just need to think more carefully about how it can work.  Solutions:  If you can safely monitor breakout rooms, these are a good way of giving students time away from the whole class to do speaking activities with one another.  Alternatively, students can still be put in open pairs to talk to each other while the rest of the students are listening. For students to feel confident enough to do this give them some thinking and planning time first.  Try using a spot the difference activity, a task students have to do in A1 Movers Speaking Part 1 and A2 Flyers Speaking Part 1. This can be done as a whole class activity or in pairs  Another way of ensuring that students talk more is to demonstrate an activity but then encourage students to lead the activity. You can find an activity in the A1 Movers Speaking Part 4 lesson plan which shows students how to make a chatterbox so they can ask their partner questions. This allows students to practise different vocabulary and asking and answering questions without needing the teacher to be involved!

        "question": "What is the most effective method for learning a new language according to Maija Kozlova, and what evidence supports this approach?",
        "context": "The benefit of immersive language-learning experiences and how to create them   by   Maija Kozlova ,  19/05/2021     Research , Language , Technology      The magic method?   the best way to learn English, teacher? This was probably one of the most frequently asked questions I was asked as an English teacher.  All students wanted to know the answer, regardless of their ability or context, from busy bankers in Santiago, Chile, to teenagers in the language centres in Bogot and Phnom Penh, to kids in the summer language schools in the UK. They all wanted to know if there is a particularly effective method that would magically speed up the process of learning.  The answer was not always what the students were prepared to hear: it wasn a set of prescribed grammar exercises they could complete, a clever mobile app they could use, or a pedagogically exceptional textbook they could work through. The answer was often met with disappointment as it was easier said than done:  you want to learn a language, you have to surround yourself with it and use it, I often say.  listen, respond  communicate!  I was not recommending immersive communication as a method of learning just because I was trained in it during my CELTA or researched it for my MA in Applied Linguistics. I firmly stood behind this approach because I lived through it. Growing up, my first two  languages were learned in the countries where they were spoken and it was not until I went to an international university where English was unavoidable that I truly mastered that language as well.  What does the research tell us?  There are numerous studies that show that students who are exposed to the language they learning in an immersive way, be it through a bilingual immersion programme at their school or a study-abroad experience, exhibit higher levels of fluency (e.g. Cummins 2009, Kinginger 2011, Wilkinson 1998), particularly when motivation to learn and absorb the language is high.

The high motivation, in turn, is fostered by the desire to belong to or approximate the culture of the target language.  We are wired to desire emotional and social connection, and when placed in contexts where such connection is only available through a foreign language, our motivation to acquire it increases. This is why learning a language in the country where it is spoken is so effective  it offers an opportunity for complete language immersion. Lots of communicative language lessons aim to mimic such immersion through meaningful context, extensive second language (L2) input and emotional engagement.  While immersive language experiences are effective in students of all ages, they can bear remarkable results in children. In second language acquisition research, there is something called  critical period hypothesis (CPH). It holds that all humans have a period (usually at a young age) during which it is possible to achieve full native competence when learning a language in a linguistically rich, immersive environment  something that has not been observed with adults.  CPH is not universally accepted and has been contested (e.g. Vanhove 2013). There are numerous studies that support the notion that children are known to be more open to learning a language intuitively, through communication, rather than through learning a set of strict rules, and that early language exposure sets learners up for success and confidence later in life (e.g. Abrahamsson and Hyltenstam 2009, Birdsong 2009, DeKeyser 2012).

There globalisation, digitalisation and increasing marginalisation. And now there COVID-19.  Back in early 2019 a small team of people from Cambridge Assessment and Judge Business School had already been thinking about how we design and deliver education, and whether it was fit for purpose. The question we were asking ourselves was:  Is education continuing to meet the needs of young people, and preparing them for the type of world they will face when they leave school?  There is a lot of important and high-profile research on this topic that strongly supports the view that some fundamental changes in education are needed:   The Future of Education and Skills OECD report makes clear that education needs to be trans formed not re formed.   A focus on compliance is driving innovative teachers from the profession according to the Director of Education and Skills at the OECD. He says education is  its relevance in an increasingly digitised world, with creative teachers often restricted by the curriculum they are expected to teach. Furthermore, he says,  is a big gap between what the world needs and what our education systems are designed for   Four out of five CEOs say that skills gaps in creativity and problem solving make hiring difficult and nearly half of job tasks may be lost to automation within the next two decades. We need to start thinking differently about how we prepare young people.   A recent Global Learner Survey clearly demonstrates perceptions that education systems are out of step with learners, and highlights the huge opportunity to reinvent learning to meet the needs of a new economy.

What we can do about the problem  As well as reading all the research, the team in Cambridge was also going to lots of education conferences. We noticed that there were  of activity at these conferences.  This meant that there would be a conference for teachers, where only teachers talked to each other. And conferences for policy people, where only policy people talked to each other. And research conferences for research people. And so on.  What we also noticed was that entrepreneurs, start-ups and innovation teams did things differently. Fundamentally, they looked outside their own worlds.

Since many countries have imposed a lockdown on movement, and many schools have subsequently closed their doors, vast numbers of previously tech-shy teachers are having to learn very quickly how to teach using online resources. This might be through delivering lessons using virtual classrooms or providing online self-study material for students, both of which may be new modes of lesson delivery for many.  Since the rise of the internet in the 1990s, English language (EL) teachers have had what might be described as a difficult relationship with technology. Initial teacher education has been slow to embrace digital ways of teaching and learning, meaning that many EL teachers feel that they have been poorly prepared to use technology in their teaching (Clark, 2018). Consequently, many EL teachers have been resistant to the digital wave which has revolutionised other areas of our lives. Understandably, there are a number of worries which teachers have regarding introducing technology into teaching. Three of the most common are:   Technology is isolating  learner interaction is limited, and dissimilar to the kind of ways that they will be required to use language in the real world.  Teachers are being deskilled, and the essence of teaching is being lost.  The rise of technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), will soon mean that teachers are made redundant.   To deal with these one at a time:  Is technology isolating for teachers?  In many situations, technology can actually facilitate interaction.

        "question": "How can technology facilitate interaction in a virtual learning environment, and what role do English language teachers play in this context?",
        "context": "technology can actually facilitate interaction. We only need think of how many of us now use our phones and social media such as WhatsApp or Facebook to communicate. This can be equally true of interaction in a virtual learning environment  if managed correctly, opportunities for language use can be optimised and students will have plenty of interaction with each other. And, whether we like it or not, these forms of interaction, mediated through digital channels, now account for a high percentage of interactions in the  world  Are EL teachers being deskilled?  EL teaching has long since stopped being a static discipline, in which teachers are primarily conveyors of declarative knowledge, i.e. facts or information. Nowadays, English teachers are better conceptualised as facilitators of learning who provide learning opportunities for their students, and give feedback to support improvement. The essence of teaching is not therefore something fixed but rather dynamic, adapting to the context and situation in which each teacher finds themselves. The facilitation of learning through technology is a highly skilled endeavour, and in many contexts can offer a really useful support to the classroom, providing students with the chance to learn in new and interesting ways.  The impact of artificial intelligence  Artificial intelligence is a 21st century spectre which haunts many professions. However, a study into which jobs are likely to be replaced by AI in the future (Frey & Osborne, 2013) found that the chances of the profession of school teacher disappearing was around 0.007, i.e. very low indeed, especially when compared with jobs such as Library Assistants (0.95), Real Estate Brokers (0.97) and Telemarketers (0.99).  This is because teaching is a complex job, requiring a range of skills, such as subject knowledge, classroom management, motivational skills, delivering feedback, differentiating learning, problem solving, emotional intelligence, counselling, etc.  the list",

This contrasts with the current state of AI, which can be described as  specific i.e. highly skilled but in one particular area, e.g. playing chess, driving a car, recognising human faces or speech. The  general skills which a teacher possesses, and the complex interaction between those, is not going to be matched by machines anytime soon.  How Cambridge English is helping  Part of the reason that EL teaching has been slow to adopt new ways of teaching through technology has been because in many contexts, schools lack motivation and/or resources to implement tech solutions in and around the classroom, and therefore, the demand for skilled digital teachers has been weak. That is clearly changing, fuelled by the need of our education systems to keep students learning through these challenging times.  There is therefore a clear and immediate necessity for professional development in teaching through technology for many teachers around the world, and Cambridge English is trying to support this need through a number of initiatives:   Firstly, a free Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) - Teaching English Online - has been launched to help teachers acquire the skills needed to teach online. The first iteration of the course attracted over 50,000 participants.  Next, a series of webinars has begun to help teachers who are working virtually. These include titles such as  teaching in tough times and  interaction and feedback in the virtual classroom See Webinars for teachers page for more details and to sign up.

As part of a world-leading university and experts in English language assessment, we have unique insight into the key criteria behind successful assessments, admissions, engagement and retention.  In our new guide, these key criteria have been brought together into one easy-to-use checklist. Colleagues working in International Admissions can use this checklist to evaluate any English language qualification and fast-track their decision-making process.  The checklist starts by considering the key questions in International Admissions. For example, What should the test cover to ensure students have the right skills for academic study? What industry standard security protocols should the test have? Is the test provider reliable? The checklist then provides specific and measurable ways to check English language tests against these key questions.  Surprising tips and trends  The guide also provides an insight into the latest trends in the English language testing market. In particular, we have recently been seeing a surge of requests for more information about remote-proctored testing and whether this will be a lasting trend.  But the reality is rather different. Even in our latest research in 2021, a large majority of students still say they prefer paper-based exams. Amongst 16-19 year olds, just 25% state a preference for computer-based exams, compared to 68% who prefer paper-based exams.  This once again underlines the key point that there really aren any one-size-fits-all options.

However, there is an increasing demand from global businesses for their employees to demonstrate effective core skills .  Core skills are often referred to as soft skills, and include social skills (such as the ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with other people), higher level thinking skills (such as thinking critically and solving problems), and more personal, emotional skills (such as personal development and self-awareness).  The Cambridge Employability Skills Framework is based on extensive research into employer needs, and groups employability skills into eight key areas of competency that need to be developed, in addition to learning English.  These eight Competencies i are:   Collaboration and Teamwork  Communication  Innovation and Problem Solving  Critical Thinking and Decision Making  Leadership and Global Citizenship  Personal Development and Management  Emotional Intelligence  Digital Literacy   Businesses around the world are finding that their future success depends on having a workforce that has these kinds of social, cognitive and emotional skills. The National Soft Skills Association found that 85% of job success comes from having well-developed soft skills, and a large-scale study into the future of jobs and jobs training identified soft skills as the most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace of the future (Rainie & Anderson, 2017).

Helping you to understand employability  Become familiar with the concept of employability and transferable skills, and think about what type of skills make a person more employable. If you are at work, you will already have some experience of and insight into what these skills entail. You may need more support if you are still a student. The Cambridge Employability Skills Framework provides a comprehensive map of employability competencies and the skills and behaviours that make up each competency. After lessons, think about how specific tasks and activities might support you in developing particular employability skills, and use the framework as a basis for reflecting which skills you have been developing and how you might make further progress.  Employability Journals  Once you are familiar with the Employability Skills Framework, create an employability journal, recording examples of when you have demonstrated specific employability skills.

        "context": "Kids are here to play  the importance of games   by   Maija Kozlova ,  16/03/2021     Research , Language , Technology      When talking about games or playing, we don often immediately think of the classroom or learning. The first thing that comes to mind is often frivolous activity that both kids and adults engage in for fun. And yet, it is not uncommon for games to be used in education.  In the English language learning classroom, games can be used as fun warm-up activities before diving into the meatier parts of the lesson, or throughout the lesson itself in order to practise the bits of grammar or vocabulary introduced earlier. In rarer instances, full lessons can be transformed into a game  an extended role-playing activity with scenarios full of opportunities to practise the language in a simulated  environment.  The role of games in education goes far beyond their entertainment value, and this is why the New Product Development team at Cambridge English now seriously explores the benefits of video games in learning and assessment.  There is extensive evidence that with the use of games, digital and non-digital alike, students of all ages show increased engagement (Auman 2011), improved retention through an active learning environment (Jones & Bursens 2015), better learning outcomes (Merchant, Goetz, Cifuentes, Keeney-Kennicutt & Davis 2015), and higher participation and achievement rates (Nadolny & Halabi 2016). Games are also known to facilitate learning and cognitive development (Bork 2012), and could even promote well-being and mental health (Granic, Lobel & Engels 2014).  For kids, play isn frivolous. It is serious stuff.  While games are well documented as being beneficial for learning at any age, their presence is non-negotiable for learning in young people.

It helps them to:   find solutions to problems as they arise through trial and error  negotiate meaning  investigate social interactions  work out the best timing, movement and strategy  build new skills and confidence.

My personal favourite is by Benjamin Spock, an American paediatrician author, who said  child loves his play, not because it easy, but because it hard. This nicely captures the delicate balance of enjoyment and challenge that makes games such an effective tool for learning.  Chocolate-covered broccoli  The term  broccoli is sometimes used to describe unsuccessful gamification  when elements of gameplay are bolted onto serious learning, without fully integrating the game and learning aspects of the experience. One example I observed as an English teacher is a  darts game, where kids get a chance to  a dart onto a target displayed on a smartboard, but only once they correctly answered a grammar question displayed just below.  While there nothing wrong with a little bit of gamification to help brighten up an otherwise dry lesson, it becomes problematic when it is used to mask the true purpose of the lesson in hopes kids won notice what you doing.

        "question": "How has the changing landscape of education and technology influenced the CELTA program and its candidates?",
        "context": "CELTA environment  However, the world in which CELTA operates is changing. In many countries English is being introduced earlier in the curriculum in compulsory education.  The explosion of digital technology is enhancing face-to-face and remote teaching, and access to online material is influencing how students can learn and want to learn. Technology also gives people opportunity for more individualised learning.  Finally, thanks to advances in neuroscience, we are starting to better understand how people acquire knowledge.  In addition to these changes, the candidature for CELTA is diversifying  both in terms of candidates first language and their level of teaching experience. For example, in 2005, 75% of candidates were speakers of English as a first language, whereas nowadays, the figure is around 50%. As far as teaching experience is concerned, in 2000 only 20% of CELTA candidates had some teaching practice, whereas data for 2016 suggests that 60% of them already have some experience as teachers.  Referring to this ever-changing context, Clare said:  felt it was necessary not to stand still. We know CELTA is doing well; it is recognised widely and it is famous for its quality. But, will that be the same if CELTA stays the same?  In order to find an answer to this question and understand what people think about CELTA, Cambridge English collected opinions from 72 CELTA centres in 16 counties, 240 tutors and (Senior) Assessors in 50 countries, 1,500 current CELTA candidates from 100 nationalities, and 300 potential candidates. The research included 31 employer interviews and 27 interviews with candidates of competitor qualifications.  How is CELTA perceived by stakeholders?  The study uncovered very high satisfaction rate and very little appetite for change in relation to CELTA. 87% of candidates agreed that the qualification prepared them very well for teaching, while 99% of centres and 83% of tutors said they were happy with its content.  Employers were another",

CELTA has been with us for over 50 years now and, as with Cambridge English exams, regular qualification reviews keep them valuable to candidates and all those involved.  Clare concluded  have a qualification that people are very happy with and do not really want to see changed. Yet the world is changing and people are going to want to have something different. We are not in a rush, but we are looking at all the options to ensure that CELTA remains relevant to all people who have depended on it throughout the years.",

        "question": "How do Cambridge English Qualifications for young learners, such as pre-A1 Starters, A1 Movers, and A2 Flyers, motivate children and their teachers to improve language skills according to the research conducted in schools in Spain, Taiwan, and Vietnam?",
        "context": "Language tests for children  gentle encouragement or too much stress?   by   Amy Devine ,  10/10/2018     Assessment , Young learners      Cambridge English Qualifications for young learners are developed specifically for children around 6  12 years of age. There are three levels, called pre-A1 Starters, A1 Movers and A2 Flyers, and each level comprises three components testing different language skills: listening, reading and writing, and speaking. The tests are designed to make learning English fun and enjoyable, and give children and their families a chance to celebrate their achievements in English. For this reason, the tests use age-appropriate activities and colourful images, and all candidates receive a certificate showing their achievement in the form of one to five shields per paper. This article uses evidence mostly from Cambridge English research in schools in Spain, Taiwan, and Vietnam to show how Starters, Movers and Flyers motivate children, encourage them and their teachers to learn the full range of language skills, and help them and their teachers see where they need to improve. The studies cited used surveys and interviews with teachers and students to gain insight into the impacts and effects of introducing Starters, Movers and Flyers [1-4].  Tests that match learners goals  Children see pre-A1 Starters, A1 Movers and A2 Flyers as being linked to their goals in life. For example, our surveys suggest that most young learners agree that learning English will be useful for them when they  new things for study abroad, or to improve their job prospects. Teachers recognise that setting the tests as learning goals is highly motivating for learners; one teacher from Madrid said  [tests] give students a goal to work towards.

For example, a teacher from Navarra commented  idea of doing an exam which is not from here, not from Navarra, they feel important and for the motivation it really good. [The children think]  I going to do Movers, and another person from another school is coming to assess me. I think they like it a lot. And if they like it a lot, they going to do it better  These findings align well with motivational theories of second language learning. For example, the  self system proposed by Prof. Zolt D of Nottingham University, suggests that learners imagine themselves when they are fluent in a second language, and these images of their future selves encourage and motivate them in their studies [5]. From the research, it appears that preparing for Starters, Movers and Flyers gives children a concrete vision of their future English speaking selves.  Teaching the five skills  The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), developed by the Council of Europe, is a set of criteria for the assessment of second or foreign language ability [6]. In the CEFR, language ability comprises five skills: reading, writing and listening, as well as spoken production and interaction. The tests assess all five of these skills. Cambridge English impact studies suggest that introducing the tests encourages teachers to focus on all five skills, and teachers and schools perceive the tests as being balanced and complete.  Introducing pre-A1 Starters, A1 Movers and A2 Flyers is also known to be helpful for teachers classroom practices; teachers in our studies have evaluated their teaching and focused on specific skills or content included in the tests[1, 2].

For example, teachers have reported incorporating more communication activities into lessons. Teachers commented that the communication activities improved the children confidence with speaking; for example, one teacher from Navarra commented  a conversation with someone they don know builds students confidence Other research conducted in Vietnam [4] revealed that after the introduction of the tests many teachers began sharing goals (i.e. standards or levels they are working towards) with learners, a practice also shown in wider education research to be strongly connected with increased learning gains.  As a result of these changes in teaching practices, young learners English language education is likely to be more balanced across all the main language skills and learners are more likely to understand and be motivated by the goals they are working towards.  Helping children to know their strengths and weaknesses  Learners abilities can vary across the five skills. For example, a learner may be strong in listening and speaking, but weaker in reading and writing. One advantage of pre-A1 Starters, A1 Movers and A2 Flyers is that performance on each part of the test (listening, reading and writing, speaking) is reported separately. Candidates receive up to five  for their performance on each part.  Research in educational psychology indicates that feedback is most effective when it relates to specific tasks and focuses on how to improve performance[7]. Likewise, our research has shown that introducing Cambridge English: Young Learners makes learners strengths and weaknesses clear in concrete ways that help teachers and learners know what to focus on. For example, teachers use performance on practice tests and exercises that are similar to pre-A1 Starters, A1 Movers and A2 Flyers to provide more detailed feedback to students [2].",

For example, one teacher in Madrid commented  say  got a bad mark in listening- what can I do about it? Students see particular problems and want to resolve them now students are much more self-aware as to their strengths and weaknesses than they were [previously]  Finally, parental awareness of tests contributes to learning and motivation because families are very important in young children lives. Schools report that as a result of adopting Starters, Movers and Flyers, parents are more aware of their children strengths and weaknesses, due to the schools using test results to increase communication with parents about their children progress [1].  Tests in tune with children cognitive development  Young learners differ markedly from adults in how they think and learn [8-10]. For example, children memory capacity and processing is more limited than adults Children have less mature reasoning abilities and are less able to make inferences than adults. They are also less consciously aware of their own learning, which is important for information processing, acting strategically and efficient decision making. Young children Theory of Mind (i.e., an awareness that others perspectives may differ from their own) is also developing. They also have more limited world knowledge and experience than adults. Importantly, young learners first language abilities and interactional skills are also not fully developed. Tests for children need to take these factors into consideration.

Pre-A1 Starters, A1 Movers and A2 Flyers are tailored to their audience in numerous ways[8]:   Visual cues and colourful illustrations are used throughout the tests.  The reading and writing requirements are reduced.  The listening tests use visual multiple choice questions and material that is appropriate to the age-group.  Topics include content that is familiar to young learners e.g., everyday objects, animals, food.  The speaking tests involve simple conversations, straightforward questions and do not use a paired format in consideration of children limited interactional skills.  Scaffolding (i.e., support to help a learner succeed in a task) is designed into the test tasks, with a clear progression in each skill from controlled tasks / questions to more open-ended ones (i.e., more to less scaffolding). Additionally, speaking examiner prompts provide progressively more scaffolding to candidates who need support on specific speaking tasks. This flexible and adaptable approach, which is part of face-to-face speaking tests, is important for children as they often have not yet fully developed strategic thinking and social skills, and allows both stronger and weaker candidates to show their English skills.   In our research, teachers report that the exercises in pre-A1 Starters, A1 Movers and A2 Flyers are well targeted to the appropriate ability level for young learners, the topics are suitable, and the tests are easy to prepare for. Teachers also value the tests as a gentle introduction that helps prepare students for taking more difficult exams in the future [2].  References   Ashton, K., A. Salamoura, and E.

Test development is a lengthy process from inception to the moment it goes   First of all, experienced item writers produce test items according to established test specifications. Next, the items are vetted by external chairs to ensure they don have any bias towards any particular group or gender. Approved test items are then piloted to make sure they work for different nationalities. Finally, statistical analyses are run to check that the items discriminate between higher and lower performing test takers.  Even when the test is running successfully, we don want to be complacent. One of the key points in the life cycle of a test is a periodic  check to ensure it continues to cover communicative language skills for a fast-evolving society. And of course, any changes made must safeguard the validity of the test and the reliability of the scores.  In Revising the A2 Key and B1 Preliminary Speaking exam , Kathryn Davies and Nick Glasson from our Assessment department report on how a periodic health check prompted changes in these exams format and task order. A review of feedback from over 500 stakeholders and testing experts highlighted several potential areas for revision.  In the case of A2 Key, there was concern that the information exchange section did not always encourage test takers to take turns, or allow stronger candidates to demonstrate their best performance. The task was subsequently revised to align more closely to the CEFR level descriptors, and allow test takers to demonstrate more fully their ability to manage simple exchanges of information on familiar topics.

Songs provide good listening practice for teenage learners  but with a difference. Songs can tell stories, and convey emotions. Music can set the scene or provide a change of mood. You could use a song at the beginning or end of a class, or build a whole lesson around it, its meaning and the singer or band.  In terms of language learning, the rhyme and rhythm of songs are great for pronunciation work. Songs often use repetition of vocabulary or a grammar structure and can be used to help learners  language use, guess the meaning of words or phrases from the context, and lead into speaking or writing activities.  All of these are useful skills for improving students general level of English as well as to prepare for an exam. Students often enjoy listening to songs in English and understanding them can be motivational.

Ask them (perhaps as a class survey) and use a range of different types of music in your classes.  Appropriacy of lyrics, videos and ads  read and listen carefully to the lyrics and watch the video all the way through before the lesson to make sure it is appropriate. Be aware of songs and videos that are hosted on websites with ads which might not be appropriate. If necessary, just play the audio rather than the video.  Music and emotions  when you select a song, be aware that listening to music can bring up different emotions. Also, the themes of some songs might be sensitive for some of your learners.

Periodic reviews are built into the ongoing quality assurance process to ensure that the skills and knowledge measured in the exams are still appropriate and relevant to the contexts in which they are used.  In Revising the A2 Key and B1 Preliminary Reading exam , Marianne Pickles, Tony Clark and Mark Elliott from our Assessment, Research and Thought Leadership, and Validation and Data Services departments, report on how one of these reviews led to exam revision. The changes were prompted by two main considerations. First, the introduction of upwards certification, where candidates who perform highly in a Cambridge English exam can be granted a certificate a CEFR level above, meant that in each exam it was necessary to include descriptors of such a level. Second, the move towards greater standardisation of exam structure in order to create a  resemblance which would help both test takers and teachers progress along the Cambridge English Qualifications learning ladder.  The review of the exams was conducted using a combination of expert judgment and statistical analysis of how tasks performed. For example, the B1 Preliminary Writing sentence transformation task, when analysed statistically, was found to actually rely on lower-level reading processes, so the decision was made to convert it to an open cloze reading task with extended text. This had the added advantage of bringing consistency of structure to all five levels, as A2 Key, B2 First, C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency all feature such a task.

In addition to checking grades and ensuring students are doing well in their classwork and practice tests, it important to understand how they are feeling.  After they done a task in class or for homework, you can ask learners to rate how confident they feel using a confidence scale. Here is an example of a scale for a writing task at B2 level:   Ask students to evaluate themselves and hand it back to you afterwards. It will help you understand their progress for any task you choose. Simply replace the text in the left column with criteria that match the activity they did in class or at home.  You be able to find out how the group is doing as a whole and see which individuals feel like they need more support in certain areas. This will help you to understand how your students are feeling and inform your planning.  Download a confidence scale  3.

        "context": "Updating the A2 Key and B1 Preliminary vocabulary lists   by   Cambridge English ,  05/11/2019     Assessment , Cambridge English Qualifications      Cambridge English has been publishing wordlists for A2 Key, B1 Preliminary and their for schools variants since 2006. The wordlists have a number of functions: specifying core vocabulary to enable item writers to produce appropriate questions at each level; giving transparent information to teachers and learners about the kind of vocabulary typically needed for exam preparation; and importantly, supporting the validity of the exam as it then contains only vocabulary which can be reasonably expected for the level.  Historically, the wordlist was compiled on the basis of teacher and expert judgements, but we are now able to use language corpora  electronic collections of language  to provide further empirical evidence for exam development. In Updating the A2 Key and B1 Preliminary vocabulary lists , Lanes, Love, Kalman, Brenchley and Pickles describe the process of updating the wordlist for A2 Key and B1 Preliminary exams and their for schools variants. The update was part of the cyclical review that all our exams periodically undergo to ensure they are fit for purpose. A main objective was to extend the breadth of vocabulary across functions and topics, and update the list to reflect the influence of social change on language  for instance,  disk has now made way for   This revision had three stages. First, experienced item writers suggested new words to expand the breadth of the wordlist, and then identified words which were no longer relevant.

In Consultation with English language teaching professionals to inform revisions to A2 Key and B1 Preliminary and their variants for schools , Debbie Howden and Angela Wright tell us about the market research employed to gather stakeholder feedback on these exams.  The authors surveyed a range of stakeholders, including over 500 teachers preparing learners for A2 Key or B1 Preliminary, and found both a high level of overall satisfaction and suggestions for improvement. For example, one of the areas under review was exam length, and as a result of consultation, the combined Reading and Writing paper for B1 Preliminary/B1 Preliminary for Schools was divided into two separate papers. The format of the reading and writing paper for A2 Key/A2 Key for Schools was also revised and the number of questions reduced. Other areas reviewed were test content and task types. A major change, based on a teacher survey, was made to test scores, which will no longer be reported as Pass with Merit or Distinction, but now as grades A/B/C, in line with higher levels of Cambridge English Qualifications .

        "question": "How can preparing for Cambridge English Qualifications help rebuild learners' motivation and sense of purpose during disruptions caused by COVID-19?",
        "context": "How preparing for Cambridge English Qualifications can help motivate learners through lockdown   by   Cambridge English ,  11/09/2020     Teaching , Classroom , Schools , Young learners      Sense of purpose  COVID-19 has meant huge disruption to learning. The best way to get learners back on track and rebuild their motivation and sense of purpose is to give them goals to work towards, whether they are back in the classroom or learning online. Preparing for a Cambridge English Qualification means that a learner knows where they are going for the next few weeks or months and gives structure to their learning, whatever age or stage of learning they are at.  Positive impact on learning  Taking an exam is not just about the end goal and the certificate. A good exam should have a positive impact on learning, and Cambridge English Qualifications are designed with this in mind. Each exam has objectives for each of the four skills of reading, writing, speaking and listening, which are broken down into relevant sub-skills at each level, e.g. at B1 level: replying to an email, listening for detail, or talking about likes. This means that teachers and learners have goals for each week and each lesson, and time is spent on developing all four skills in authentic situations. If there is no exam to prepare for, lessons may be less focused, less time may be spent on some skills, and learners may feel less motivated as there is less sense of direction.  Support for parents  Parents can help their child, at any age, with both practical and emotional support, helping to ensure they stay motivated. We provide a range of support to help with this, taking into account that parents may not speak English or have much time.

Results for Cambridge English Qualifications are designed to give learners, parents and teachers a clear understanding of the progress they have made, what they can do in English and what the next steps are in their learning journey.  Standing out  In these difficult times, having a qualification that demonstrates a student ability in English can help them to stand out when they leave school and apply for university or jobs. While this may seem a long way off for younger learners, it is important to ensure that they don fall behind now as this could have an impact on what they will achieve when they are older.

        "question": "What is the educational philosophy that underpins Cambridge English's approach to teacher education, and how does it conceptualize the process of learning?",
        "context": "Developing teachers: key principles in the Cambridge English approach to teacher education   by   Graeme Harrison ,  11/06/2019     Professional development , Teaching , English Language Consultancy      Cambridge English has long been recognised as one of the international leaders in pre-service teacher education through the CELTA (Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) qualification. In recent years, we have been working around the world at a national level with both in-service and pre-service teachers to improve levels of pedagogical skill and knowledge in a variety of different countries, for example Panama , Ukraine and Malta .  Underpinning the work that we do in teacher education are a number of guiding principles which spring from our educational philosophy. We believe that learning is best conceptualised through a social constructivist theory of learning. A key tenet of this is the view that learning is constructed by the learner, as opposed to the traditional,  model of teaching and learning in which knowledge is passed on to students fully formed, ready to be assimilated. Furthermore, learning is primarily a social activity  knowledge and skills are constructed through interaction with others. This is an extension of Vygotsky sociocultural theory, which maintains the primacy of social interactions, mediated through the prevailing culture, in a child development (Salkind, 2004).  Based on this philosophical approach, Cambridge English have developed a number of key principles which inform our work in teacher education.  Learning is an active process  Learners build their knowledge through active engagement with learning opportunities. Therefore, teachers are required to be  (Hattie, 2009, p. 243), and should encourage active learning through setting learning goals, providing engaging tasks, assessing achievement and giving targeted feedback.

        "context": "through setting learning goals, providing engaging tasks, assessing achievement and giving targeted feedback.  Learning is additive, incremental and takes time  Learning takes place in small steps and builds on the learner existing knowledge structures (Johnson, 2006). In order to be fully incorporated into these knowledge structures, a learner needs to interact with new information three or four times (Nuthall, 2000). Therefore, teacher education should seek to work with what teachers already know, introducing new ideas and methods gradually, with time for assimilation, practical application, and reflection during the learning process.  Feedback and reflection play important roles in learning  Hattie (2009) emphasised the importance of feedback in learning when he suggested that it should be inseparable from instruction, the two working together to help a learner construct and reconstruct knowledge. Reflection on this feedback is also crucial as it allows learners to self-assess learning, and formulate their next actions. Writing specifically about teacher education, Borg and Albery (2015) suggest that reflective practice should underpin all teaching and learning.  Learning should be goal-focused and evidence-based  Learners should know in advance what they are aiming to learn, and also, how they can measure their achievement against this learning aim. Teacher education should therefore provide clear goals from the outset, and incorporate assessment of achievement which produces data that can support teachers in achieving these goals.  Experiential learning and practice are needed for skills development  Skills are developed through on-the-job practice, and any career which has a practical element incorporates this in its education programme  consider medical professionals and pilots as just two examples.

Teaching is no different in this regard, and any teacher education programme should include an element of real teaching in real classrooms, with the chance to receive feedback and reflect on performance.  Peer-collaboration is an effective way to learn  Learning from others is a key tenet in a social constructivist theory of learning, and this seems particularly true in teacher education: in their 2007 report, McKinsey and Company identified how, in a number of high-performing education systems, teacher collaboration has been found to facilitate teacher development. Equally, Schleicher (2018) noted that evidence from the OECD TALIS (Teaching and Learning International Survey) study suggested that professional development activities for teachers had most impact when mediated through group work.  Attitude to learning plays a key role  A consistent finding in high-performing education systems is that students believe that achievement is a function of hard work rather than innate intelligence (Schleicher, 2018). This attitude to learning has been termed a  mind-set (Dweck, 2006). It is therefore important that teacher education programmes emphasise the importance of a growth mind-set among teachers in order for them to pass it on to their students.  Digital is increasingly a useful facilitator of learning  Using digital resources, e.g. apps, websites, and software, allows new avenues of learning to be accessed. This may be through changes to formal learning such as facilitating blended learning and the flipped classroom, or it may be through more informal tools e.g. apps on a smart phone. ICT and digital tools have become increasingly prominent in teaching and learning globally, and therefore, more than ever, should be considered an important component of teacher education programmes.

Talk about successful language learning requirements  When talking to parents, make it clear about what language learning requirements are and how Cambridge English Qualifications can support them.   Motivation  this is crucial to learners developing their English skills.  Confidence  using a foreign language requires having confidence in all four skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking). It is particularly important for young learners that confidence is built up gradually and maintained over time.  Fun  children are more likely to stay motivated if they are enjoying themselves.  Clear objectives  having clear and realistic goals increases learners motivation as they have a better understanding of how they are progressing.  Right level and content  at a young age, children are still developing their first language skills. They have limited world knowledge and reasoning skills. Children will perform better if the materials they use take these factors into account and are appropriate to their age and level. To be successful in learning a language, you also need to learn all the different skills and not just grammar and vocabulary, or the passive skills of reading and listening.  Practice  learning any new skill requires practice and getting to a good level takes time. Starting young will help to give learners an advantage in their lifelong language learning journey.   4.

Technology can handle tasks that a teacher cannot do  whether through lack of time, or resources  and can add real value to the classroom. It important, for teachers to understand that a positive, proactive relationship with technology can help them and their learners. To achieve these outcomes, however, teachers need to expand and maintain their knowledge of learning technologies, and develop their ability to critically assess digital learning tools in order to identify those which offer the greatest benefit to their students.  What teachers can do better than tech  A fundamental role for the teacher is to foster social learning. Social learning features interaction, discussion and collaboration between students, and creates a positive, inter-personal learning climate. It involves taking a flexible and interactive approach which encourages engagement across the class, while also retaining a  sensitivity to individual needs. As this type of learning is focused on the application of knowledge, it also encourages higher-order thinking skills such as analysis and evaluation, or  in the case of language learning  the development of communicative competence. Current digital technologies cannot enable this type of social and collaborative learning as well as a teacher can, since such learning environments are highly dependent on the inter-personal relationship between the teacher and their class. Technology, instead, delivers learning content in an  way, as the educator Philip Kerr notes, where learning is",

In terms of classroom administration, for example, technology can provide enhanced record keeping, greatly improving the teacher analysis of student performance, especially the identification of skills which could be improved by deliberate practice. This is where technology can really help. Deliberate practice in order to consolidate knowledge is considered essential for learning, but is challenging to do at class level as it takes time and requires specific focus on individual learners.  Digital tools allow students to practice practise discrete language skills repeatedly (e.g. specific grammar points or vocabulary), and for as long as they want or need to. Adaptive learning technologies  where tasks are adjusted according to ongoing student performance  can further extend deliberate practice. Teachers naturally adapt the content they use based on the ability of specific learners, but that difficult to do for individual learners; technology can provide adaptive learning experiences on a larger scale in an automated manner (but on limited domains of knowledge). Technology can also add value with marking of student work, and can provide feedback on student writing and aspects of speaking. (An example is Write and Improve , a writing development and feedback tool which is free for learners to use.) By marking students work, technology can reduce the administrative burden on teachers and give them more time for classroom teaching (although it cannot offer",

By marking students work, technology can reduce the administrative burden on teachers and give them more time for classroom teaching (although it cannot offer the depth or nuance a teacher can provide).  What tech can do better than teachers  On-demand learning combined with instant feedback, delivered quickly and on a large scale, is a major advantage of language learning technology. Practice is vitally important for the individual, but it a real challenge for time-poor teachers who often have to deal with large classes, so the ability to access digital tools and feedback at anytime, anywhere, represents a significant expansion in learning opportunities and should (theoretically) lead to accelerated progress. The best digital tools will provide learning without any human biases, and without teacher burn-out, while also generating invaluable  data on learning and progression. This data is already being used to improve the efficiency and accuracy of digital tools, and by teachers who use it to inform their own classroom practice.  The teacher and technology  an essential partnership  It often the case that technology is warmly welcomed by students but not by teachers, whether because they lack the skills to use it properly, doubt its real value, or see it as a threat to their professional status. But I hope we shown how  in the language classroom at least  technology can play a highly productive role, provided that it is mediated by a skilled teacher equipped with both language learning expertise and knowledge of digital tools. Teachers must learn how to assess and critique technology in order to identify those tools best placed to make a real contribution to the classroom.

They have had no choice but to work out problems on their own with no classmate and no teacher nearby to ask.  As lockdown is lifted in many places, learners are starting to return to school. They may feel relieved that the sense of isolation they felt at home is over. But things have changed. They find themselves sharing a classroom space, but in the socially distanced classroom, they continue to work apart.  This is a challenge for teachers. The communicative classroom has changed. How can you recreate the energy of students working together and sharing sustained and meaningful interaction? Group work and pair work could be more difficult and the learners may have to spend more time working on their own or as a whole class.  The socially distanced classroom is an opportunity to revisit classroom strategies that build on the skills that were easier to practise at home, as well as developing the language skills they couldn practise so easily during lockdown, such as speaking.  Here are some examples of activities that require little preparation and encourage communication in the socially distanced classroom. If your situation allows for pair work and group work, the activities can easily be adapted.  They provide good practice for learners preparing for B1 Preliminary for Schools/B1 Preliminary, B2 First for Schools/B2 First and C1 Advanced but they can also be used in general English teaching.

You can also download our Top tips for teaching English online .  1. Choose your platform and teaching tools  Before you start, you need to decide on a platform to deliver your online classes. Some teachers choose Google Classroom , which is a free online learning management service for schools. It facilitates collaboration, creativity, file sharing and grading  and of course works well with all other Google platforms, like G Suite for Education , Google Docs, Google Slides, and so on.  Introduction to Google Classroom    Alternatively, you could explore Flipgrid . Free for teachers to sign up, Flipgrid is designed for all levels of education  from pre-primary to postgraduate. It especially good for sharing videos, collaboration and storytelling.  In addition, there Zoom , a video conferencing and teaching platform which has exploded in popularity recently. It comes with a built-in interactive whiteboard, space for up to 100 students, file sharing, breakaway rooms for group work and chat features. Zoom has a generous free plan, though sessions can only last up to 40 minutes (at which point you would need to restart the lesson to continue or upgrade to a Pro account).  Skype is another option, however it will require all your students to download the software and create an account.  Google Hangouts is a useful tool if you have a Google account.

You can also download our Quick-start guide to teaching English online and our tips on How to choose the right online platform for your classroom .  2. Technology requirements  As a teacher, you need to administer your course, create materials, broadcast your class, interact with your students and grade their work. For efficiency, you need a laptop, a desktop computer or a professional tablet.  Your students will also need a laptop or computer if they want to fully participate in your classes. However, smartphones or tablets with an internet connection can be used when there no alternative.  3. Privacy and safety online  When delivering any kind of class online, you needa to take safety and privacy seriously. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ruling in Europe means teachers (and their schools) have the responsibility to treat their students data carefully, safely and with respect. GDPR may also affect educators who work outside of Europe if their students live abroad.  The regulations provide sensible guidance for managing personal data so are well worth reading up on. Our article covering What you need to know about security when teaching learners online also has some really useful advice on safety.  4. Training  Dedicate a portion of your first class to helping your students get to grips with the technology. Even if you spend half of the first session doing so, it will save you time explaining things to individuals over and over again.

You can even use these introductory videos as listening activities and play games on the whiteboard to try out functionality.  5. Space and resources  Where possible, set aside a dedicated area in your home or office to teach from. Make sure you have all the visual aids and materials you need to hand. This will help you feel you are in a classroom and will help you be more spontaneous and creative during your lessons. This is especially important in young learner classes, where you might need to change the pace of the class using flashcards, puppets or even costumes!  Encourage your learners to do the same and set up a designated study area. If your students are very young, ask their parents to help. This will help them get in the right frame of mind to focus on learning.  Additionally, ensure that nothing in view of the camera can identify your home address, any sensitive information like bank details, any book titles you wouldn want to be associated with, any information about your children, etc. If this information is accidentally (or purposefully) shared online it can be a security risk.  6. Learning objectives  It can be difficult for students to adjust to online learning, especially when they joining your class from their homes. Bring them into your lessons by starting all your classes with learning objectives.  Use your chat box or interactive whiteboard to share what you will cover during the class and explain what you expect from your students. This will help students focus and feel like they are in a regular classroom. At the end of the class, you can reflect on what you done together and whether you have achieved what you set out to do.  7. Create a routine  Do your best to develop a routine in the classroom.

Also, make sure you mix study with energising games or mini-breaks and have students share their ideas.  8. Delivering instructions  Online teaching lets you deliver instructions to all your students verbally and in written format. You can also ask students to confirm their understanding in chat boxes and speak to individuals if they are unclear about what to do. Unlike in a physical class, every student can do this at the same time  so you can check everyone is on track.  Depending on which platform you use, there a good chance you also be able to share your materials, documents and presentation slides, and display and use other activities like online quizzes and games with the class, which will help them follow along with ease.  9. Classroom management  Online classrooms can be easier to manage than physical ones. It unlikely that you be interrupted by students whispering at the back of the class, passing notes or running around. However, you might be interrupted if students have their microphones on while you speaking  and they can talk to each other via chat box and get distracted with irrelevant online content.

It pays to be a little larger than life on camera. Exaggerate your expressions and tone of voice slightly so they stay alert and interested in what you have to stay (just don overdo it).  You can also keep them on their toes by having every single student in the class respond to your questions by typing in the chat box. That will ensure they pay attention. Incorporating fun digital tools such as Quizlet or Quizizz will help keep learners engaged too.  You could also use a spinner to nominate students for tasks and questions to build a sense of fun and suspense  or get students to nominate each other!  Remember, just because they quiet doesn mean they not learning.  11. In-class group work  Mix up your activities to keep things interesting. Just because you online, it doesn mean students can collaborate. Many platforms allow you to put students in pairs or groups to work together in designated chat rooms. As a teacher, you can drop in and out of these rooms to monitor how things are going, and give feedback just as you would in a regular class.

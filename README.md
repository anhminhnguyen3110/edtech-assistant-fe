## Quiz

Any changes made to a question require clicking **Save** to apply the updates or **Delete** to remove the question entirely. Additionally, when hovering over a question in the left panel for more than one second, a preview will appear, showing how the quiz will look during the game.

### Detail for a Class in an Assignment

After clicking "View" for a class in an assignment, you will be directed to a detailed page showing a list of extracted issues, generated lessons, and quizzes for that class.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Assignment-Instruction.gif" alt="Assignment-Instruction.gif">
</p>

**Issue Extraction**

The application extracts common issues identified for the entire class in an assignment. However, the issue extraction function is not triggered automatically from students' work. Users must manually initiate this process when first entering the class page for an assignment. The automatic issue extraction feature can only be used if no issues have already been identified in the list.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Assignment-ExtractIssue.gif" alt="Assignment-ExtractIssue.gif">
</p>

The extraction process can take up to 10 minutes. During this time, you can perform other tasks, and a notification will pop up when the process is complete, as shown in the example. If you choose to stay on the page, it will automatically load the issues once the process is finished, thanks to WebSocket, which receives real-time updates. Once you used the automatic issue extraction you can only re-use it after 2 hours.

**Issues Editing**

You can manually add or edit issues if needed. However, there is a limit of 10 issues that can be added.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Assignment-EditIssue.gif" alt="Assignment-EditIssue.gif">
</p>

Lessons can only be generated if at least one issue has been identified. To generate a lesson, click the "Generate Lesson" button and specify the desired file name. Once the lesson is generated, you can download it to view the content.

Once a lesson is generated, you can rename it as desired. There is a limit of five lessons per class in an assignment. If you wish to generate additional lessons, you will need to delete existing ones first.

<p align="center">
